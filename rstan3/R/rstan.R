#' Estimate and diagnose models using Stan
#' 
#' This R package provides an interface to the Stan C++ library or more
#' specifically links to the \pkg{StanHeaders} package, which provides the
#' header files of the Stan C++ libraries.
#' 
#' Starting from \pkg{rstan} 3.0, the syntax of \code{\link[methods]{ReferenceClasses}}
#' is heavily utilized by the \pkg{rstan} package. This syntax may be unfamiliar
#' to many \R users but is similar to that in Python. In particular, various
#' \code{\link{ReferenceClasses}} are defined with fields and methods. These
#' methods are \code{\link{function}}s that may utilize the fields in addition
#' to any arguments of the methods. Perhaps the biggest syntactic difference is
#' that these methods are called using the \code{$} operator, such as
#' \code{object$plot()} rather than \code{plot(object)}. To list the methods
#' that are defined for \code{\link[methods]{ReferenceClasses}}, postfix \code{$}
#' to the object name and press the Tab key. To obtain help for any defined
#' method, use the \code{$help(topic)} method, where \code{topic} is the name
#' of the method you need help with.
#' 
#' The basic steps for defining, estimating, and diagnosing a Stan model are as
#' follows.
#' 
#' @section Step 0 --- Write a Stan program:
#' Preferably save a file with a .stan extension to your hard disk that
#' constitutes a valid Stan program or you can write a valid
#' Stan program as a \R \code{\link{character}} vector. A simple illustration 
#' of a Stan program is given in the examples section below. More details about 
#' the Stan language are at \url{https://mc-stan.org/documentation}, but in brief
#' a Stan program has one or more of the following blocks contained within curly 
#' braces:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item functions: an optional section for users to define functions that
#'     can subsequently be used in that Stan program only or can be exported
#'     to the \R by calling \code{link[rstan]{expose_stan_functions}}
#'   \item data: an all-but-required section for users to declare known 
#'     quantities, including the outcome to be modeled, its predictors,
#'     hyperparameters, dimensions, etc. These are passed from R.
#'   \item transformed data: an optional section for users to define other
#'     known quantities that are related to the objects declared in the \code{data} 
#'     block and hence is only executed once. It is also possible to do random
#'     number generation in this block.
#'   \item parameters: an all-but-required section to declare the unknowns
#'     that are being estimated and hence are saved in the output
#'   \item transformed parameters: an optional section for users to define
#'     unknown quantities that are conditionally deterministic given the
#'     objects in \code{parameters}, \code{transformed data}, and \code{data}.
#'     The \code{transformed parameters} block is executed every time the
#'     objective function is evaluated, the constraints on the objects therein
#'     are checked, and the objects are saved in the output
#'   \item model: an all-but-required section for users to build up an
#'     expression for the objective function, which may consist of both priors
#'     and a likelihood to form a posterior kernel. Local objects can be declared
#'     at the top of the \code{model} block but their are not saved in the output.
#'   \item generated quantities: an optional section where users can define
#'     additional objects that depend on anything in the previous sections
#'     \emph{except} the \code{model} section and may involve random-number
#'     generation. The \code{generated quantities} section is executed once
#'     per iteration and is useful for producing posterior predictive 
#'     distributions.
#' }
#' The Stan language supports the several types of objects. These same types are now
#' available in \R via S4 classes, as documented by the \code{\link{StanType-class}}.
#' 
#' @section Step 1 --- Build your Stan program:
#' Either pass a file path to the \code{file} argument of the 
#' \code{\link{stan_config}} constructor or pass specify the \code{mode_code}
#' argument. For example, \code{post <- stan_build(file = "MyStanFile.stan")} 
#' would locate a file called MyStanFile.stan in the working directory on the 
#' hard disk. If the \code{file} argument is unspecified, a dialogue box will
#' open (in \code{\link[base]{interactive}} mode) that will prompt you to a file
#' on your hard disk. An illustration of the \code{model_code} argument is given  
#' in the examples section below. Either approach will cause the Stan syntax to
#' be parsed to C++ and (if successful) compiled, which may take a considerable 
#' amount of time. This will create an object of \code{\link{StanModule-class}}.
#' 
#' By default \code{stan_build} will look in the calling environment for R 
#' objects named in the data block of the Stan program and will use them to
#' instantiate the C++ object that ultimately estimates the unknown parameters.
#' However, you can (and should) specify these arguments explicitly when calling
#' \code{stan_build} as illustrated in the example below. If the R objects have
#' the same names as the Stan objects, then you can simply pass them. Otherwise,
#' use the \code{tag = object} R syntax as for any other \code{\link{list}},
#' where \code{tag} is the name of the object in the data block of the Stan
#' program.
#' 
#' @section Step 2 --- Estimate the unknowns your model:
#' There are a variety of methods for an object of \code{\link{StanModule-class}}
#' that can be invoked to estimate the unknowns of your model in various ways.
#' The preferred way is to draw from the posterior distribution using Markov 
#' Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, but it is also possible to use Automatic 
#' Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) with either a meanfield or a 
#' fullrank assumption on the covariance matrix of the multivariate normal 
#' distribution that is closest to the posterior distribution in the 
#' unconstrained space. Finally, it is possible to find the mode of a
#' log-likelihood (if not priors are specified) or a posterior mode (if priors
#' are specified) using various deterministic optimization algorithms that also
#' make use of automatic differentiation to evaluate the gradient with respect
#' to the unknowns in the unconstrained parameter space. These algorithms can
#' be called with their default arguments by invoking one of the following
#' methods:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{sample}: MCMC, specifically No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) with
#'     adaptive integration time, a tuned diagonal mass matrix, and a 
#'     Euclidean metric
#'   \item \code{advi}: ADVI with a diagonal covariance matrix
#'   \item \code{maximize}: The LBFGS mode-finding algorithm
#' } 
#' Other algorithms can be invoked (possibly with non-default arguments) via 
#' the corresponding methods, which are documented with the 
#' \code{\link{StanModule-class}}.
#'  
#' @section Step 3 --- Diagnose any problems:
#' The best way to diagnose problems with MCMC is to call the 
#' \code{\link[shinyStan]{launch_shinystan}} function in the 
#' \pkg{shinyStan} package, but this requires user interactivity. Many
#' static plots can be produced interactively or by a script (via the 
#' \pkg{bayesplot} package) by invoking the methods for an object of 
#' \code{\link{StanMCMCFit-class}}. However, the most basic methods are 
#' \code{show} and, for more detail, \code{summary}.
